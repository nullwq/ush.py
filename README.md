Just grab the HTTPshell.py file (Yes, a single file) from the releases and this acts as both as a client & a server.
```
$ httpshell.py 
usage: httpshell.py [-h] [--server] [--server-install] [--uninstall] [-s SECURE] [-f FAST] [user] [host]

positional arguments:
  user
  host

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --server
  --server-install
  --uninstall
  -s, --secure SECURE
  -f, --fast FAST
```
